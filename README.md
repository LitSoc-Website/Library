# LitSoc Library Management System

A modern digital library platform for **LitSoc**, built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and **TypeScript**.  
It handles core book operations—catalog management, user accounts, and the lending system—while integrating with the club’s other digital initiatives like the Book Allocation System and Blog Platform.

> Development is active on the [`br2`](https://github.com/LitSoc-Website/Library/tree/br2) branch.
